Setup

 - Ensure you have Python 2.7 installed.
 - Run `pip install -r requirements.txt` from the base directory.

How to run
---
 1. Run `pip install -r requirements.txt`
 2. Run `python -i run.py`
 3. Wait for the index to occur
 4. Batch Queries are then performed and results output to the scren.

How to Evalutate
---
 1. Download the tree_eval script from the assignment page.
 2. Point your terminal to the unzipped dir and type 'make'
 3. If `make` doesn't work you might need to install Xcode. 
 4. Test it worked with `make quicktest`

Now when you run run.py it will take the query texts, and batch run them, and just dump in console directly the content of the results file
